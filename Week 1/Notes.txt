Knowledge Based Agents:
    Concepts of TOC and Discrete Mathematics
    For the computers to understand and embed logic using AI, we use Propositional logic
    P Q R used as Proposition symbols 
    ¬ , ^ , v , ->, <-> 

    Not:
        P   ¬P
        T    F 
        F    T 

    And:
        P   Q   p ^ q  
        T   T    T 
        T   F    F 
        F   T    F 
        F   F    F 

    OR:
        P   Q   p V q  
        T   T    T 
        T   F    T 
        F   T    T 
        F   F    F     
    
    Implies: If P is true, then q is true.. Case 2, since we had P as true but the implication is false, we say that the statement is false

        P   Q   p -> q  
        T   T    T 
        T   F    F 
        F   T    T 
        F   F    T 

    Biconditional

        P   Q   p <-> q  
        T   T    T 
        T   F    F 
        F   T    F 
        F   F    T     

    Knowledge Base:
        Alpha entails Beta:
        In every model if Alpha is true then Beta is also true
        Inference: 
        The process of deriving new sentences using old ones

    For eg:
        P: It is Tuesday 
        Q: It is raining
        R: Harry will go for a run

    Knowledge Base(KB): (P^ ¬ Q) -> R     P     ¬Q    
    Inference: R 

    Does KB entails Alpha 

    In order to answer the above Question, we use 
    Model Checking: We have to enumerate all possible models 

    Knowledge Engg:
        Use Logical symbols to arrive at an Inference
    Logic Puzzles:
        Drawing conclusions by defining the KB
    
    Model Checking is not efficient.. It makes all the possible models and checks for each variable and seeks if it is true in all the 
    universes

    Inference Rules:
        Premise - Conclusion 
        Modus Ponens: Alpha -> Beta ^ Alpha Then Beta
        And Elimination: Alpha ^ Beta Then Alpha
        Double Negation Elimination: ¬(¬Alpha) Then Alpha
        implication Elimination: Alpha -> Beta = ¬Alpha V Beta
        Biconditional Elimination: Alpha <-> Beta Then (Alpha->Beta) ^ (Beta->Alpha)
        De Morgan's Law: ¬(Alpha ^ Beta) = ¬Alpha V ¬Beta
        De Morgan's Law: ¬(Alpha V Beta) = ¬Alpha ^ ¬Beta
        Distributive Law: Alpha ^ (Beta V Gamma) = (Alpha ^ Beta) V (Alpha ^ Gamma)
    Additional Rules:
        (P V Q) ^  ¬ Q -> P 
        (P V Q) ^ (¬P V R) -> Q V R 
        Disjuction: OR 
        Conjunction: AND 
        CNF or CDNF
        (P V Q) -> R 
        ~(P V Q) V R 
        (~P ^ ~Q) V R 
        (~P V R) ^ (~Q V R)
    Inference of Resolution:
         To determine if KB entails Alpha:
            KB ^ ~ Alpha is a contradiction.. To prove this we use this Elimination technique is CS to prove this
        For eg: (A V B) ^ (~B V C) ^ (~C) entail A?

        (A V B) ^ (~B V C) ^ (~C) ^ (~A) should be () then we can conclusively say that it entails A
    First Order Logic: Better way to express common ideas 
        Person(Minerva) : Minerva is a Person
        House(Ravenclaw) : Ravenclaw is a House
        ~House(Minerva) : Minerva is not a House
        BelongsTo(Minerva,Griffindor) : Minerva BelongsTo Griffindor

        With Universal Quantification: For all symbol
        Existential Quantification: True for atleast one variable
